# Server-Security-Discord-Bot
Anti-Nuke capabilities, powerful moderation features, auto punishments, captcha-verification and more.


## Tip
A little tip from me, you can copy the code or download the files. But you have no real learning effect. So if you use the code then please analyze it and go through it so you understand how it is built and how it works! 


## Installation
Install all dependencies:
* `Open Setup.bat`
* Then add your Discord token, which you can find in the Discord developer portal, to the very bottom of the `main.py` file 
* This bot have to use the "server members intent", so you have to enable it in the Discord's developers portal
Finally you can host the bot and invite it to your own server.


## Features
With some powerful features, Server Security will be able to protect your server from being nuked, raided, malicous users, spammer etc.
* Anti-Nuke
* Captcha-Verification
* Join-Filter
* Auto-Moderation
* Panic-Mode
* Moderation Commands
* General Commands
* Multi guild support
Tip: The bot needs the ADMINISTRATOR permission! Restrictions do not affect members with ADMINISTRATOR permission!
